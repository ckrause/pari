Done for version 2.10.0 (released ??/??/??):
  Fixed
      1- subst(1+x^3+O(x^6),x,x+O(x^4)) -> SEGV [#1865]
BA    2- lfunartin was using too much stack
BA    3- fflog in char 3 or 5 was slower than intended
      4- RgX_blocks only worked for t_INT or t_POL coeffs
      5- spurious bnrdlisclist entries (with negative number of real
         places...) when modulus not a conductor
BA    6- modular algorithms could fail for very large input
BA    7- [mingw] writebin did not work

     10- matrixqz(m, -1 or -2) was very slow
     11- ZG_normalize destroyed its input
     12- [install] prototype code D0,U, did not work
BA   13- use of complex default function argument could lead to stack error.
     14- factorpadic(2*x^4+x^2,2,2) -> division by 0 [#1876]
     15- incgam(110, I) very inaccurate
BA   16- ellinit over number field was not compatible with generic operations.
BA   17- [breakloop] dbg_up could confuse the breakloop.
HC   18- sumnummonieninit(,,a) + sumnummonien(n = a, ...) with a > 1 gave wrong
         result
     19- sumnummonieninit([a,b], t_CLOSURE) => incorrect initialization
     20- lngamma(1+epsilon) much slower than in pari-2.7; eg. 10^-4 at \p200
BA   21- lfun(...,t_SER,n>=1) returned a wrong result
     22- lfun(,, negative derivation order) => internal bug
     23- SEGV in sumnummonieninit when accuracy too low
BA   24- ellidentify: check curve is over Q

     18- [libpari] hammingl, RgM_is_QM, vecsmall_prod, zm_permanent,
         ZM_permanent
     19- lfuncreate: no longer assume Ramanujan-Petersson, allow specifying

BA   20- new GP function vecprod

  Changed
      1- rewrite bnfnarrow
      2- the bid struct from idealstar has been changed, the new format is
         not compatible with pari-2.9
      3- bnrdisclist output is now an ordinary vector (not a vector of vectors)
      4- made nfsign() / nfsign_arch() reliable [ use algebraic method
         besides floating point approximation to real embeddings ]
      5- support ??refcard-ell  (or mf/nf/lfun)
      6- [libpari internals] bnrinit(,,1) [with generators] is no longer
         necessary for bnrsurjection()
      7- bnrinit(,,1) is no longer necessary for bnrL1, bnrconductor,
         bnrrootnumber, bnrstark, rnfkummer, galoissubcyclo
      8- msfromell: use a (much faster) modular algorithm, allow a vector
         of isogenous curves
      9- mseval(W,s,p): allow 2x2 matrix for the path 'p' argument
     10- allow mseval(W, t_MAT, p) to evaluate many symbols simultaneously
     11- allow polrootsreal() and polsturm() with non-rational real polynomials
         (input is rounded first)
BA   12- FlxX_shift did not support negative (left) shift.
BA   13- [libpari] rename FpX_fromdigits -> FpXV_FpX_fromdigits,
         FpXQX_fromdigits -> FpXQXV_FpXQX_fromdigits
     14- made lngamma(t_COMPLEX) faster
     15- made sumnummonieninit(,1) faster
HC   16- sumnummonieninit(a) for [a,a] did not conform to documentation.
         Change to sumnummonieninit(b) for [1,b]
     17- improve prime() and primepi() by adding more checkpoints [#1878]
     18- lfun(Dirichlet character): switch automatically to lfunchiquad
         (Kronecker) if char has order <= 2
     19- nfchecksigns: replace by rigorous algorithm
     20- asympnum: better tunings => usually finds more terms
     21- extended help: make ?? op work for ALL operators (=> GP operators@2)

  Removed
      1- file 'MACHINES' (no longer maintained)
      2- useless argument nf in ZC_nfval, ZC_nfvalrem, pr_equal, ZC_prdvd
