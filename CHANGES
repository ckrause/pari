BA   2- [loongarch64] add loongarch64 assembly kernel
BA   3- [libpari] closuretoinl
BA   4- [libpari] using closuretoinl, closures can be made usable with E/I
        GP prototype codes
BA   5- quadclassunit now uses MPQS for negative discriminants.
AP   6- [libpari] FqC_red, FqM_red, FqC_to_FFC, FqM_to_FFM
     7- [libpari] pr_anti_uniformizer
AP   8- new GP functions algeltfromnf, algmodprinit, algmodpr, algmodprlift,

AP  10- new GP functions algquattobasis, algbasistoquat, algisquatalg
BA  11- new GP functions ellchangecompose, ellchangeinvert
HC  12- zetahurwitz(t_PADIC,,d): use dth-power of the Teichmuller character
BA  13- [libpari] ZVV_nv_mod_tree, ZVV_to_FlvV
MTB 14- gen_order: implement faster recursive algorithm
MTB 15- FpXQ_sqrt: implement fast algorithm
BA  16- [libpari] F2xqX_Frobenius, F2xqX_nbroots, FF_nbroots
    17- core, ispowerfu, moebius: implement fast trial division
AP  18- new GP function alginvol

  Changed
BA   1- idealfactorback, rnfisnorminit: flag is now a long to match GP proto.
     2- polsturm obsolete undocumented form polsturm(pol, a, b) where a or b
        could be omitted is now disabled. Use polsturm(pol, [a,b]), where
        a = -oo and b = +oo can be used instead of an omitted argument.
     3- undocumented deprecated 3-arguments form of deprecated function
        polred is now disabled. Use polredbest !
     4- [libpari] deprecated function polred0 implementing deprecated polred
        function now accepts only two arguments: the 3 argument form
        polred0(x, flag, fa = NULL) is no longer possible. Use
          polred0(mkvec2(x, gel(fa,1)), flag)
        instead. And preferably polredbest!
AP   5- allow algpoleval(al, basis form, relative polynomial).
AP   6- alginit: construction from Hasse invariants now allows a shortcut in the
        quaternion case, giving only the ramification set.
AP   7- alginit(nf,[a,b]) now allows a to be a square in nf.
     8- nfmodpr now returns a t_INTMOD when the residue field is Z/pZ
     9- [libpari] oncurve renamed ellisoncurve_i
    10- ellchangepoint / ellchangepointinv: now require the elliptic curve as
        first argument (to indicate the domain over which the transformation
        is performed); backward compatibility is maintained for now:
        ellchangepoint(P, urst) still works when it used to do; but
        ellchangepoint(E, P, urst) now works also when E, P, urst are defined
        over a number field with components in basis form
    11- renamed ZC_hnfremdiv -> ZC_hnfdivrem
    12- factorint: after trial division, never use rho first. Start by squfof
        then rho.

  Removed
BA   1- GP function trap, use iferr instead.
BA   2- GP functions listcreate, listkill, use L = List() instead.
