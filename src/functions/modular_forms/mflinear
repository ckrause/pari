Function: mflinear
Section: modular_forms
C-Name: mflinear
Prototype: GG
Help: mflinear(vF,v): vF being a vector of modular forms and v
 a vector of coefficients of same length, compute the linear
 combination of the entries of vF with coefficients v.
Doc: \kbd{vF} being a vector of modular forms and \kbd{v}
 a vector of coefficients of same length, compute the linear
 combination of the entries of \kbd{vF} with coefficients \kbd{v}.
 \misctitle{Note} Use this in particular to subtract two forms $F$ and $G$
 (with $vF=[F,G]$ and $v=[1,-1]$), or to multiply an form by
 a scalar $\lambda$ (with $vF=[F]$ and $v=[\lambda]$).
