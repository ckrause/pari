C-Name: mfreltoabs
Prototype: Gp
Help: mfreltoabs(F): F being a modular form (usually, but not necessarily, an
 eigenform), return the same form where coefficients are now given modulo an
 absolute polynomial over Q, instead of a relative polynomial over Q(chi)
Doc: $F$ being a modular form (usually, but not necessarily, an
 eigenform), return the same form where coefficients are now given modulo an
 absolute polynomial over $\Q$, instead of a relative polynomial over
 $\Q(\chi)$.
