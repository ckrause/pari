Help: mffromqf(Q,{P = 1}): Q being an even positive definite quadratic form
 and P a homogeneous spherical polynomial for Q, computes a 3-component vector
 [mf,F,coeffs], where F is the theta function corresponding to (Q, P), mf is
 the corresponding space of modular forms from mfinit, and coeffs are the
 coefficients of F on mfbasis(mf).
Doc: $Q$ being an even integral positive definite quadratic form
 and $P$ a homogeneous spherical polynomial for $Q$, computes
 a 3-component vector $[\var{mf},F,v]$, where $F$ is the theta function
 corresponding to $(Q,P)$, \var{mf} is the corresponding space of modular
 forms (from \kbd{mfinit}), and $v$ gives the coefficients of $F$ on
 \kbd{mfbasis(mf)}. A homogeneous polynomial in variables $(x_1,\dots,x_n)$
 is spherical for $Q$ (of dimension $n$) if $ \Delta_Q P = 0$, with
 $$ \Delta_Q = {}^t(d/d x_1,\dots,d/d x_n)
            Q^{-1} (d/d x_1, \dots, \dots x_n).$$
 In particular, if $Q$ is the identity, then $\Delta_Q$ is the standard
 Laplacian $d^2/d x_1^2 + \dots + d^2/d x_n^2$.
