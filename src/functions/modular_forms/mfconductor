Function: mfconductor
Section: modular_forms
C-Name: mfconductor
Prototype: lGG
Help: mfconductor(mf,F): mf being output by mfinit and F a modular form,
 gives the smallest level at which F is defined.
Doc: \kbd{mf} being output by \kbd{mfinit} for the cuspidal space and
 $F$ a modular form, gives the smallest level at which $F$ is defined.
 In particular, if $F$ is cuspidal and we write $F = \sum_{j} B(d_{j}) f_{j}$
 for new forms $f_{j}$ of level $N_{j}$ (see \kbd{mftonew}), then its conductor
 is the least common multiple of the $d_{j} N_{j}$.
