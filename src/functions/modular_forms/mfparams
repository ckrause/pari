Function: mfparams
Section: modular_forms
C-Name: mfparams
Prototype: G
Help: mfparams(F): Returns [N,k,CHI], level, weight, and character:
 F is either a modular form space or a modular form; in the latter case
 the program searches though the tree which created the modular form, and
 the level N may be a multiple of the level of F.
Doc: Returns \kbd{[N,k,CHI]}, level, weight, and character:
 \kbd{F} is either a modular form space  or a modular form; in the latter case
 the program searches though the tree which created the modular form, and
 the level N may be a multiple of the level of F. If you want the true
 level of F from this result, use \kbd{mfconductor(mfinit([N,k,CHI],3),F)}.
