Help: mfparams(F): If F is a modular form space, returns [N,k,CHI,space]:
 level, weight, character, and space code. If F is a modular form,
 returns [N,k,CHI,P], where P is the (polynomial giving the) field of
 definition of F: in that case the level N may be a multiple of the level of F
 and the polynomial P may define a larger field than Q(F).
Doc: If $F$ is a modular form space, returns \kbd{[N,k,CHI,space]}, level,
 weight, character, and space code. If $F$ is a modular form, returns
 \kbd{[N,k,CHI,P]}, where $P$ is the (polynomial giving the) field of
 definition of $F$: in that case the level $N$ may be a multiple of the
 level of $F$ and the polynomial $P$ may define a larger field than $\Q(F)$.
 If you want the true level of $F$ from this result, use
 \kbd{mfconductor(mfinit(F),F)}. The polynomial $P$ defines an extension of
 $\Q(\chi) = \Q[t]/(\Phi(t))$ for the cyclotomic polynomial of order
 $f(\chi)$; it has coefficients in that number field (polmods in $t$).
