Function: mfsearch
Section: modular_forms
C-Name: mfsearch
Prototype: GGD4,L,
Help: mfsearch(NK,V,{space}): NK being of the form [N,k] with k possibly
 half-integral, search for a modular form with rational coefficients, of weight
 k and level less than or equal to N, whose initial coefficients
 a(0),... are equal to V. The output is a list of possible [N,k,D], where
 D is a (positive or negative) fundamental discriminant dividing N.
 If a form is found at level N, any multiple of N with the same D is not
 considered. space specfies the modular form spaces in which to search. Note
 that this is very different from mfeigensearch, whose syntax is different,
 and which only searches for rational eigenforms.
