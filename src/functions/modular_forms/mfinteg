Function: mfinteg
Section: modular_forms
C-Name: mfinteg
Prototype: GD1,L,
Help: mfinteg(F,{k=1}): k-th formal integration of the power series
 corresponding to the modular form F, with respect to the differential operator
 q.d/dq. Only forms with no constant term can be integrated
 (default k=1).
Doc: $k$-th formal integration of the power series corresponding to
 the modular form $F$, with respect to the differential operator
 $qd/dq$. Only forms with no constant term can be integrated
 (default $k=1$).
