Help: mfdim(NK,{space=0}): If NK=[N,k,CHI] as in
 mfinit, gives the dimension of the corresponding subspace of
 M_k(G_0(N),chi). The parameter space is by default 0, coding the newspace,
 and can also be 1 for the cuspidal space, 2 for the oldspace, 3 for the full
 space M_k and 4 the space of Eisenstein series. NK can also be the output of
 mfinit, in which case space must be omitted.
Doc: If $NK=[N,k,\var{CHI}]$ as in \kbd{mfinit}, gives the dimension of the
 corresponding subspace of $M_k(\Gamma_0(N),\chi)$. $NK$ can also be the
 output of \kbd{mfinit}, in which case space must be omitted.

 The parameter \kbd{space} is as in \kbd{mfinit}: by default $0$, coding the
 newspace $S_k^{\text{new}}(\Gamma_0(N),\chi)$, and can also be $1$ for the
 cuspidal space $S_k$, $2$ for the oldspace $S_k^{\text{old}}$, $3$ for the
 full space $M_k$ and $4$ for the space of Eisenstein series $E_k$.

 \misctitle{Wildcards}
 As in \kbd{mfinit}, \var{CHI} may be the wildcard 0
 (all Galois orbits of characters); in this case, the output is a vector of
 $[\var{order},\var{conrey},\var{dim},\var{dimdih}]$ corresponding
 to the non-trivial spaces, where

 \item \var{order} is the order of the character,

 \item \var{conrey} its Conrey label from which the character may be recovered
 via \kbd{znchar}$(\var{conrey})$,

 \item \var{dim} the dimension of the corresponding space,

 \item \var{dimdih} the dimension of the subspace of dihedral forms
 corresponding to Hecke characters if $k = 1$ (this is not implemented for
 the old space and set to $-1$ for the time being) and 0 otherwise.

 The spaces are sorted by increasing order of the character; the characters are
 taken up to Galois conjugation and the Conrey number is the minimal one among
 Galois conjugates. In weight $1$, this is only implemented when
 the space is 0 (newspace), 1 (cusp space) or 2(old space).

 \misctitle{Wildcards for sets of characters} \var{CHI} may be a set
 of characters, and we return the set of $[\var{dim},\var{dimdih}]$.

 \misctitle{Wildcard for $S_k(\Gamma_1(N))$}
 Additionally, the wildcard $\var{CHI} = -1$ is available in which case we
 output the total dimension of
 $S_k(\Gamma_1(N))$. In weight $1$, this is only implemented when
 the space is 0 (newspace), 1 (cusp space), or 2(old space).

 @eprog
 This last example shows that there exists a nondihedral form of weight 1
 in level 124.
