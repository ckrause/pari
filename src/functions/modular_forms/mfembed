Function: mfembed
Section: modular_forms
C-Name: mfembed
Prototype: Gp
Help: mfembed(F): F being a modular form (usually, but not necessarily, an
 eigenform), outputs the vector of forms obtained by substituting the formal
 variable of the polmod giving the coefficients of F
 by all its embeddings into the complex numbers in the order given by polroots.
 This is in particular useful before using mfeval if the coefficients of
 F are not rational.
Doc: $F$ being a modular form (usually, but not necessarily, an eigenform),
 outputs the vector of forms obtained by substituting the
 formal variable of the polmod giving the coefficients of $F$ by all its
 embeddings into the complex numbers in the order given by \kbd{polroots}.
 This is in particular useful before using mfeval if the coefficients of
 $F$ are not rational.
