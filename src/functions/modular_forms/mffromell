Help: mffromell(E): E being an elliptic curve defined over Q given by an
 integral model in ellinit format, computes a 3-component vector [mf,F,coeffs],
 where F is the newform corresponding to E by modularity, mf is the split
 newspace to which F belongs, and coeffs are the coefficients of F on
 mfbasis(mf).
