Function: mfatkininit
Section: modular_forms
C-Name: mfatkininit
Prototype: GLp
Help: mfatkininit(mf,Q): initializes data necessary for working
 with Atkin--Lehner operators W_Q, for now only the function mfatkin.
 Although technical, it is essential to know what this function returns:
 the result is a 4-component vector mfatk, as follows: mfatk[1] is either
 0 or the possibly different modular form space to which F|W_Q will belong
 (this does not depend on F); mfatk[2] is $C$ times the matrix of $W_Q$
 on the basis of mf; mfatk[3] is the complex constant C, and mfatk[4]=mf.

 $W_Q$, for now only the function \kbd{mfatkin}. Although technical, it is
 essential to know what this function returns: the result is a 4-component
 vector \kbd{mfatk}, as follows: \kbd{mfatk[1]} is either
 $0$ or the possibly different modular form space to which $F|W_Q$ will
 belong (this does not depend on $F$); \kbd{mfatk[2]} is $C$ times the

 constant $C$, and \kbd{mfatk[4]=mf}. The matrix \kbd{mfatk[2]} has polmod
 coefficients in $\Q(\chi)$.
