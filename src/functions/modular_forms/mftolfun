C-Name: mftolfun
Prototype: GD0,L,b
Help: mftolfun(mf,{flag=0}): If mf is an eigenform which is already
 embedded in C, outputs the corresponding L-function. If
 mf is a space, output the L-functions corresponding to all
 eigenforms, and in that case mf must be a split new space. The binary
 digits of flag mean 1: assume the form is real (resp. all eigenforms are
 real); 2: assume the form is cuspidal.
Doc: If \kbd{mf} is an eigenform which is already embedded in $\C$, outputs
 the corresponding L-function, ready for use with \kbd{lfunxxx} programs.
 The binary digits of \fl mean

 \item $1$: assume the form is real;

 \item $2$: assume the form is cuspidal.

 If \kbd{mf} is a space, it must be a split new space; output the
 vector of \kbd{lfuncreate}s attached to all eigenforms. The result
 is a vector whose length is the dimension of the space: each Galois orbit of
 dimension $d$ has $d$ corresponding \kbd{lfuncreate}s, one for each
 embedding.
