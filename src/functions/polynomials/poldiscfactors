Function: poldiscfactors
Section: polynomials
C-Name: poldiscfactors
Prototype: G
Help: poldiscfactors(T,{flag=0}): [D, faD], where D = discriminant of the
 polynomial T, and faD is a partial factorization of D
 (entries are coprime but need not be primes); if flag is 1, finish the
 factorization via factorint.
Doc: given a polynomial $T$ with integer coefficients, return
 $[D, \var{faD}]$ where $D$ is the discriminant of $T$ and
 \var{faD} is a partial factorization of $D$: entries in its first
 column are coprime but need not be primes. If \fl is $1$, finish the
 factorization using \kbd{factorint}.
