Function: polsubcyclo
Section: polynomials
C-Name: polsubcyclo0
Prototype: GLDn
Help: polsubcyclo(n,d,{v='x}): finds an equation (in variable v) for the d-th
 degree subfields of Q(zeta_n). Output is a polynomial, or a vector of
 polynomials if there are several such fields or none.
Doc: gives polynomials (in variable $v$) defining the (Abelian) subextensions
 of degree $d$ of the cyclotomic field $\Q(\zeta_n)$, where $d\mid \phi(n)$.

 If there is exactly one such extension the output is a polynomial, else it is
 a vector of polynomials, possibly empty. To get a vector in all cases,
 use \kbd{concat([], polsubcyclo(n,d))}.

 Each such polynomial is the minimal polynomial for a Gaussian period
 $\text{Tr}_{\Q(\zeta_n)/L} (\zeta_n)$, where $L$ is the degree $d$
 subextension
 and $\zeta_n$ is a primitive $n$-th root of $1$. In Galois-theoretic terms,
 $L = \Q(\zeta_n)^H$, where $H$ runs through all index $d$ subgroups
 of $(\Z/n\Z)^*$.

 The function \tet{galoissubcyclo} allows to specify exactly which
 sub-Abelian extension should be computed by giving $H$.
