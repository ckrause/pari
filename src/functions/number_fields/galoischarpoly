Function: galoischarpoly
Section: number_fields
C-Name: galoischarpoly
Prototype: GGD1,L,
Help: galoischarpoly(gal, chi, {o=1}): return the list of characteristic
 polynomials of the representation attached to the character chi.
Doc: Let $\chi$ be the character of some representation $\rho$ of the group
 $G$. Return the list of characteristic polynomial of $\rho{g}$, where $g$
 runs through representatives of the conjugacy classes.
