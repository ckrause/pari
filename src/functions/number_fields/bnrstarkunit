Function: bnrstarkunit
Section: number_fields
C-Name: bnrstarkunit
Prototype: GDG
Help: bnrstarkunit(bnr,{subgroup}): bnr being as output by
 bnrinit, returns the characteristic polynomial of the (conjectural) Stark unit
 corresponding to the module in bnr and the given congruence subgroup (the trivial
 subgroup if omitted). The ground field must be totally real and all but one infinite
 place must become complex in the class field.
Doc: \var{bnr} being as output by \kbd{bnrinit}, returns the characteristic polynomial
 of the (conjectural) Stark unit corresponding to the modulus in \var{bnr} and the given
 congruence subgroup (as usual, omit $\var{subgroup}$ if you want the whole ray
 class group).

 The main variable of \var{bnr} must not be $x$, and the ground field must be totally
 real and not the field of rationals. All but one infinite place must become complex in
 the class field and it must be a quadratic extension of its totally real subfield. Here
 is an example:
 \bprog
 bnf = bnfinit(y^2 - 2);
 bnr = bnrinit(bnf, [15, [1,0]]);
 bnrstarkunit(bnr)
