Function: idealfactor
Section: number_fields
C-Name: gpidealfactor
Prototype: GGDG
Help: idealfactor(nf,x,{lim}): factorization of the ideal x into prime ideals
 in the number field nf. If lim is set return partial factorization, using
 primes < lim.
Doc: factors into prime ideal powers the ideal $x$ in the number field
 $\var{nf}$. The output format is similar to the \kbd{factor} function, and
 the prime ideals are represented in the form output by the
 \kbd{idealprimedec} function. If \var{lim} is set, return partial
 factorization, including only prime ideals above rational primes
 $< \var{lim}$.
Variant: This function should only be used by the \kbd{gp} interface. Use
 directly \fun{GEN}{idealfactor}{GEN x} or
 \fun{GEN}{idealfactor_limit}{GEN x, ulong lim}.
