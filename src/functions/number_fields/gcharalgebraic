Function: gcharalgebraic
Section: number_fields
C-Name: gchar_algebraic
Prototype: G
Help: gcharalgebraic(gc): returns a matrix whose rows form a basis of the
 algebraic Grossencharacters in gc.
Doc: \var{gc} being the structure returned by \kbd{gcharinit}, return a \typ{MAT}
 whose rows form a basis of the subgroup of algebraic Grossencharacters in \var{gc}
 (Weil type A0).
 The last component is interpreted as a power of the norm.
