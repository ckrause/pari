Function: gcharalgebraic
Section: number_fields
C-Name: gcharalgebraic
Prototype: GDG
Help: gcharalgebraic(gc,{type}): returns a matrix whose rows form a basis of the
 algebraic Grossencharacters in gc. If type is specified as a vector of
 integer exponents [p,q] for each complex place, return a vector containing
 an algebraic character of that infinity type (or the empty vector if such a character does
 not exist).
Doc: \var{gc} being the structure returned by \kbd{gcharinit}, return a \typ{MAT}
 whose rows form a basis of the subgroup of algebraic Grossencharacters in \var{gc}
 (Weil type A0). The last component is interpreted as a power of the norm.

 If \var{type} is a \typ{VEC} of length $\var{gc}\kbd{.r1}+\var{gc}\kbd{.r2}$,
 with values $(p_\tau,q_\tau)$ for complex embedding $\tau$, return a character
 whose infinity type is
 $$z \mapsto \prod_\tau z_\tau^{p_\tau}\bar{z}_{\tau}^{q_\tau}.$$
 The full set of characters of that infinity type is obtained by multiplying by
 a finite order character.
