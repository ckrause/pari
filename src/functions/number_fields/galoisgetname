Doc: Query the galpol package for a string describing the group of order $a$
 with index $b$ in the GAP4 Small Group library, by Hans Ulrich Besche,
 Bettina Eick and Eamonn O'Brien.
 The strings were generated using the GAP4 function StructureDescription.
 It is possible for different groups to have the same name.
 The command below outputs the names of all abstract groups of order 12:
 \bprog
 ? for(i=1,galoisgetgroup(12),print(i,":",galoisgetname(12,i)))
 1:C3 : C4
 2:C12
 3:A4
 4:D12
 5:C6 x C2
