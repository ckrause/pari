Help: nfweilheight(nf, v): return the absolute Weil height of the vector v seen
 as an element of the projective space over the number field nf given by nfinit.
Doc: let \var{nf} be attached to a number field $K$, let $v$ be a vector of
 elements of $K$, seen as element of the projective space of dimension
 \kbd{\#v - 1}. Return the absolute Weil height of that element.
