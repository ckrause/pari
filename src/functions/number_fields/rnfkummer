Function: rnfkummer
Section: number_fields
C-Name: rnfkummer
Prototype: GDG
Help: rnfkummer(bnr,{subgp}): bnr being as output by bnrinit,
 finds a relative equation for the class field corresponding to the module in
 bnr and the given congruence subgroup (the ray class field if subgp is
 omitted).
Doc: \var{bnr}
 being as output by \kbd{bnrinit}, finds a relative equation for the
 class field corresponding to the module in \var{bnr} and the given
 congruence subgroup (the full ray class field if \var{subgp} is omitted).

 \misctitle{Warning} This routine only works for subgroups of prime index. It
 uses Kummer theory, adjoining necessary roots of unity (it needs to compute a
 tough \kbd{bnfinit} here), and finds a generator via Hecke's characterization
 of ramification in Kummer extensions of prime degree. If your extension does
 not have prime degree, use \kbd{bnrclassfield}.
