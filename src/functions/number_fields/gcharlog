Function: gcharlog
Section: number_fields
C-Name: gchar_log
Prototype: GGp
Help: gcharlog(gc,x): returns the internal representation (logarithm) of the
 ideal x suitable for computations in gc, as a column vector.
Doc: Return the internal representation of the ideal $x$ suitable for
 computations in $gc$, as a \typ{COL} in $\R^n$.

 Its $n = \kbd{ns+nc}+(r_1+r_2)+r_2$ components correspond to a
 logarithm map on the group of fractional ideals~${\cal L}: I \to \R^n$, see
 \kbd{gcharinit}.

 More precisely, let $x = (\alpha) \prod \goth{p}_i^{a_i}$ a
 principalization of $x$ on a set $S$ of primes generating
 the class group (see \kbd{bnfisprincipal}),
 then the logarithm of $x$ is the \typ{COL}
 $$
  {\cal L}(x) = \left[ (a_i), \log_f(\alpha), \dfrac{\log|x/\alpha|_\tau}{2\pi},
 \dfrac{\arg(x/\alpha)_\tau}{2\pi} \right]
 $$
 where

 \item the exponent vector $(a_i)$ has \kbd{ns} components, where
 $\kbd{ns}=\#S$ is the number of prime ideals used to generate the class group,

 \item $\log_f(\alpha)$ is a discrete logarithm of
 $\alpha$ in the \kbd{idealstar} group $(\Z_K/f)^\times$, with \kbd{nc} components,

 \item $\log|x/\alpha|_\tau$ has $r_1+r_2$ components, one for each
 real embedding and pair of complex embeddings $\tau\colon K\to\C$
 (and $|z|_\tau=|z|^2$ for complex $\tau$).

 \item $\arg{(x/\alpha)_\tau}$ has $r_2$ components, one for each
 pair of complex embeddings $\tau\colon K\to\C$.
