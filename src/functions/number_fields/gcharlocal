C-Name: gcharlocal
Prototype: GGGp
Help: gcharlocal(gc,chi,v): if v is a place which is infinite or unramified for
 chi, return the local character chi_v.
Doc: \kbd{gc} being a gchar structure initialised by \kbd{gcharinit}, returns
 the local component $\chi_v$, where $v$ is either a \typ{INT} between~$1$
 and~$r_1+r_2$ encoding an infinite place, or a prime ideal structure encoding a
 finite place. If~$v$ is a real place, $\chi_v(x) = {\rm sign}(x)^k
 |x|^{i\varphi}$ is encoded as~$[k,\varphi]$; if~$v$ is a complex place,
 $\chi_v(z) = (z/|z|)^k |z|^{2i\varphi}$ is encoded as~$[k,\varphi]$; if~$v =
 \goth{p}$ is a finite place at which~$\chi$ is unramified, $\chi_v(\goth{p}) =
 \exp(2i\pi \theta)$ is encoded as~$[\theta]$. Currently not implemented for
 ramified finite primes.
