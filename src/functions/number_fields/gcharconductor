Section: number_fields
C-Name: gchar_conductor
Prototype: GG
Help: gcharconductor(gc,chi): returns the conductor of chi, as a modulus over gc.bnf.
Doc: returns the conductor of \kbd{chi}, as a modulus over \kbd{gc.bnf}. This is
 the minimum modulus $\goth{m}$ such that $U(\goth{m})\subset\ker(\var{chi})$
 indicating the exact ramification of \var{chi}.

 \item for a real place $v$, $v\mid \goth{m}$ iff $\chi_v(-1)=-1$.

 \item for finite places, $\goth{p}^e\parallel \goth{m}$ if $\chi_{\goth p}(1+\goth{p}^e\Z_{\goth p})=1$.
