C-Name: gchar_conductor
Prototype: GG
Help: gcharconductor(gc,chi): returns the conductor of chi, as a modulus over gc.bnf.
Doc: returns the conductor of \kbd{chi}, as a modulus over \kbd{gc.bnf}. This is
 the minimum modulus $\goth{m}$ such that
 $U(\goth{m})\subset\text{ker}(\var{chi})$
 indicating the exact ramification of \var{chi}.

 \item for a real place $v$, $v\mid \goth{m}$ iff $\chi_v(-1)=-1$.

 \item for a finite place~$\goth{p}$, the prime power~$\goth{p}^e$ divides
 exactly $\goth{m}$ if $e\ge 0$ is the smallest integer such that $\chi_{\goth{p}}
 (U_e)=1$ where~$U_0 = \Z_{\goth{p}}^\times$ and~$U_i =
 1+\goth{p}^e\Z_{\goth{p}}$ for~$i>0$.
