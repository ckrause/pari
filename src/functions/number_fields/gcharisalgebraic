Function: gcharisalgebraic
Section: number_fields
C-Name: gcharisalgebraic
Prototype: iGGD&
Help: gcharisalgebraic(gc,chi,{&type}): returns 1 if chi is an algebraic (type A0)
 character. If type is present, set it to the infinity type [p,q] of chi.
Doc: \var{gc} being the structure returned by \kbd{gcharinit} and \var{chi}
 a character on \var{gc}, return 1 if and only if chi is an algebraic (Weil type
 A0) character, so that its infinity type at every complex embedding~$\tau$ can
 be written
 $$
  z \mapsto z^{-p_\tau}\bar{z}^{-q_\tau}
 $$
 for some pair of integers $(p_\tau,q_\tau)$.

 If \var{type} is given, set it to the \typ{VEC} of exponents $[p_\tau,q_\tau]$.
