C-Name: gcharisalgebraic
Prototype: iGGD&
Help: gcharisalgebraic(gc,chi,{&type}): returns 1 if chi is an algebraic (type A0)
 character. If type is present, set it to the infinity type [p,q] of chi.
Doc: \var{gc} being the structure returned by \kbd{gcharinit} and \var{chi}
 a character on \var{gc}, return 1 if chi is an algebraic (Weil type A0) character,
 so that its infinity type can be written
 $$ z \mapsto \prod_\tau z_\tau^{p_\tau}\bar{z}_{\tau}^{q_\tau} $$
 for pairs of integers $(p_\tau,q_\tau)$ for each complex embedding $\tau$.

 If \var{type} is given, set it to the \typ{VEC} of exponents $[p_\tau,q_\tau]$.
