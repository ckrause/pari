C-Name: galoischartable
Prototype: G
Help: galoischartable(gal): return the character table of the underlying
 group of gal.
Doc: Compute the character table of~$G$, where~$G$ is the underlying group of
 the \kbd{galoisinit} structure~\var{gal}. The input~\var{gal} is also allowed
 to be a \typ{VEC} of permutations that is closed under products.
 Let~$N$ be the number of conjugacy classes of~$G$.
 Return a \typ{VEC}~$[\var{ct},\var{e}]$ where $e \geq 1$ is an integer
 and \var{ct} is a square \typ{MAT} of size~$N$ giving the character table
 of~$G$.

 \item Each row corresponds to a conjugacy class; the conjugacy classes are
 ordered as specified by \kbd{galoisconjclasses(gal)}, in particular the
 first row is the identity.

 \item Each column corresponds to an irreducible character; the characters
 are ordered by increasing dimension and the first column is the trivial
 character (hence contains only $1$'s).

 The value $M[i,j]$ of the character $j$ at the conjugacy class $i$
 is represented by a polynomial in \kbd{y} whose variable should be
 interpreted as an $e$-th root of unity. (Note that this is the transpose
 of the usual orientation for character tables.) Since the first conjugacy
 class is the identity, the first column contains the dimensions of the
 characters.

 The integer $e$ divides the exponent of the group $G$ and is chosen as small
 as posible; for instance $e = 1$ when the characters are all defined over
 $\Q$, as is the case for $S_n$. Examples:
