Function: setdebug
Section: programming/control
C-Name: setdebug
Prototype: DsD-1,L,
Help: setdebug({D},{n}):
 sets debug level for domain D to n (n must be between 0 and 20).
 If n is omitted, returns the current level for domain D.
 if D is omitted, returns a two-column matrix which lists the available domains
 with their levels.
Doc: sets debug level for domain $D$ to $n$ ($0 \leq n \leq 20$).
 The domain $D$ is a character string describing a Pari feature or code
 module, such as \kbd{"bnf"}, \kbd{"qflll"} or \kbd{"polgalois"}. This allows
 to selectively increase or decrease the diagnostics attached to a particular
 feature.
 If $n$ is omitted, returns the current level for domain $D$.
 If $D$ is omitted, returns a two-column matrix which lists the available
 domains with their levels. The \kbd{debug} default allows to reset all debug
 levels to a given value.
 \bprog
 ? setdebug()[,1] \\ list of all domains
 ["alg", "arith", "bern", "bnf", "bnr", "bnrclassfield", ..., "zetamult"]

 ? \g 1   \\ sets all debug levels to 1
   debug = 1
 ? setdebug("bnf", 0); \\ kills messages related to bnfinit and bnfisrincipal

Variant: Also available is
  \fun{void}{setalldebug(long n): sets all debug domains to level \var{n}.
