Help: parforeach(V,X,expr1,r,expr2):
 evaluates the expression expr1 in parallel for all components X of V
 resulting in as many values; if the formal variables r and expr2 are present, evaluate
 sequentially expr2, in which r has been replaced by the different results
 obtained for expr1 and X with the corresponding components.
Doc: evaluates in parallel the expression \kbd{expr1} in the formal
 argument $X$ taking the components of $X$ as value.
 If $r$ and \kbd{expr2} are present, the expression \kbd{expr2} in the
 formal variables $r$ and $X$ is evaluated with $r$ running through all
 the different results obtained for \kbd{expr1} and $X$ takes the
 corresponding argument.
