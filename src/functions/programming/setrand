Function: setrand
Section: programming/specific
C-Name: setrand
Prototype: vG
Help: setrand(n): reset the seed of the random number generator to n.
Doc: reseeds the random number generator using the seed $n$. No value is
 returned. The seed is either a technical array output by \kbd{getrand}, or a
 small positive integer ($0 \leq n < 2^{32}$, or $2^{64}$ on 64-bit
 architectures), used to generate deterministically a suitable state array.
 For instance, running a randomized computation starting by \kbd{setrand(1)}
 twice will generate the exact same output. In order to reproduce a
 particular random state without setting it first to, we can use
 \kbd{getrand}:
 \bprog
 ? state = getrand(); \\ record seed
 ...
 ? setrand(state); \\ we can now replay the exact same computations
