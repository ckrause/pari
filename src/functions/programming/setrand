Function: setrand
Section: programming/specific
C-Name: setrand
Prototype: vG
Help: setrand(n): reset the seed of the random number generator to n.
Doc: reseeds the random number generator using the seed $n$. No value is
 returned. The seed is a small positive integer $0 < n < 2^{64}$ used to
 generate deterministically a suitable state array. All gp session start
 by an implicit \kbd{setrand(1)}, so resetting the seed to this value allows
 to replay all computations since the session start. Alternatively,
 running a randomized computation starting by \kbd{setrand}($n$)
 twice with the same $n$ will generate the exact same output.

 For debugging purposes, one can also record a particular random state
 using \kbd{getrand} (the value is encoded as a huge integer) and feed it to
 \kbd{setrand}:
 \bprog
 ? state = getrand(); \\ record seed
 ...
 ? setrand(state); \\ we can now replay the exact same computations
