Doc: memory debugging level. If it is non-zero, \kbd{gp} will notify when
 \kbd{parisize} changes (within the boundaries set by \kbd{parisizemax})
 If it is greater than 2, indicate any important garbage collecting and the
 function it is taking place in (see~\b{gm}). If greater than 3, it will
 indicate the creation/destruction of ``blocks'' (or clones).

 \noindent {\bf Important Note:}
 if you are running a version compiled for debugging (see Appendix~A),
 \kbd{gp} will regularly print information on memory usage if \kbd{debugmem}
 is $\geq 2$. This functionality is disabled on non-debugging builds as it
 noticeably slows down the performance.

 The default value is \kbd{1} (no debugging messages except \kbd{parisize}
 changes).
