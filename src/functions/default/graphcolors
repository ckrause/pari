Doc: entries in the
 \tet{graphcolormap} that will be used to plot multi-curves. The successive
 curves are drawn in colors whose index in \kbd{graphcolormap} are the
 non-negative integers

 \kbd{graphcolors[1]}, \kbd{graphcolors[2]}, \dots

 cycling when the \kbd{graphcolors} list is exhausted. Beware that for
 historical and compatibility reasons, \kbd{graphcolormap} is $0$-based.

 The default value is \kbd{[4,5]}. With factory settings for
 \kbd{graphcolormap}, this corresponds to \kbd{"red"} then \kbd{"green"}.
