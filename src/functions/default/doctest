Doc: If set to $1$, this default allows to copy-paste examples from the
 documentation unmodified and check whether results match (doctesting). In
 this mode, \kbd{gp} discards lines starting with a whitespace, unless the
 first non-whitespace character is a prompt ('?' followed by a space), in
 which case the prompt is ignored, the rest of the input line is evaluated,
 and the result is output as usual. Can also be switched on and off
 using \b{z}.

 The default value is \kbd{0}.
