Doc: if set to $1$, \kbd{gp} will discard lines starting with a whitespace,
 unless the first non-whitespace character is '?' followed by a space, in which
 case this character is ignored.
 This way, examples from the documentation can be read unmodified. Can also be
 switched using \b{z}.

 The default value is \kbd{0}.
