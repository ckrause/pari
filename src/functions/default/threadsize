Doc: This default is specific to the \emph{parallel} version of PARI and gp
 (built via \kbd{Configure --mt=prthread} or \kbd{mpi}) and is ignored
 otherwise. In parallel mode,
 each thread allocates its own private \tev{stack} for its
 computations, see \kbd{parisize}. This value determines the size in bytes of
 the stacks of each thread, so the total memory allocated will be
 $\kbd{parisize}+\kbd{nbthreads}\times\kbd{threadsize}$.

 If set to $0$, the value used is the same as \kbd{parisize}. It is not
 easy to estimate reliably a sufficient value for this parameter because PARI
 itself will parallelize computations and we recommend to not set this value
 explicitly unless it solves a specific problem for you. On the other hand we
 strongly recommend to set \kbd{parisizemax} and \kbd{threadsizemax} to a
 non-zero value.

 The default value is $0$.
