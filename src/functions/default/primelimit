Doc: \kbd{gp} precomputes a list of
 all primes less than \kbd{primelimit} at initialization time, and can build
 fast sieves on demand to quickly iterate over primes up to the \emph{square}
 of \kbd{primelimit}. These are used by functions looping over consecutive
 small primes. A related default is \kbd{factorlimit} deciding an upper
 bound for the small primes that can be quickly detected through fast trial
 division; note that is \kbd{primelimit} is set to a lower value than
 \kbd{factorlimit}, it is silently increase to match \kbd{factorlimit}.

 Since almost all arithmetic functions eventually require some table of prime
 numbers, PARI guarantees that the first 6547 primes, up to and
 including $65557$, are precomputed, even if \kbd{primelimit} is $1$.

 The default value is $2^{20}$.
 A value of $2^{32}$ allows to iterate over primes up to $2^{64}$, and is
 the upper range of what is generally useful. (Allow for a startup time of
 about 6 seconds.) On the other hand, \kbd{factorlimit} is more expensive: it
 must build a product tree of all primes up to the bound, which can
 considerably increase startup time. A \kbd{factorlimit} of $2^{32}$ will
 increase startup time to about 5 minutes; and is only useful if you
 intend to call \kbd{factor}$(N, D)$ \emph{many} times with values of $D$ about
 $2^{32}$.

 This default is only used on startup: changing it will not recompute a new
 table. Here are sample timings for startup using increasing
 values of \kbd{primelimit}:
 \bprog
 2^20:      40 ms
 2^23:     230 ms
 2^26:   2,410 ms
 2^29:  27,240 ms
 2^32: 293,660 ms

 \misctitle{Deprecated feature} \kbd{factorlimit} was used in some
 situations by algebraic number theory functions using the
 \tet{nf_PARTIALFACT} flag (\tet{nfbasis}, \tet{nfdisc}, \tet{nfinit}, \dots):
 this assumes that all primes $p > \kbd{factorlimit}$ have a certain
 property (the equation order is $p$-maximal). This is never done by default,
 and must be explicitly set by the user of such functions. Nevertheless,
 these functions now provide a more flexible interface, and their use
 of the global default \kbd{factorlimit} is deprecated.

 \misctitle{Deprecated feature} \kbd{factor(N, 0)} is used to partially
 factor integers by removing all prime factors $\leq$ \kbd{factorlimit}.
 Don't use this, supply an explicit bound: \kbd{factor(N, bound)},
 which avoids relying on an unpredictable global variable.

 The default value is $2^{20} = 1048576$.
