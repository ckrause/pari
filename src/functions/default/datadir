Doc: the name of directory containing the optional data files. For now,
 this includes the \kbd{elldata}, \kbd{galdata}, \kbd{galpol}, \kbd{seadata}
 packages.

 The default value is \kbd{/usr/local/share/pari}, or the override specified
 via \kbd{Configure --datadir=}.

 \misctitle{Windows-specific note:} on Windows operating systems, the
 special value \kbd{\@} stands for ``the directory where the \kbd{gp}
 binary was installed to by our installer'', which contains all packages we
 are looking for. This is the defaut value.
