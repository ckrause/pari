Function: plotdraw
Section: graphic
C-Name: plotdraw
Prototype: vGD0,L,
Help: plotdraw(w,{flag=0}): draw rectwindow w. More generally,
 w can be of the form [w1,x1,y1, w2,x2,y2,etc.]: draw rectwindows wi
 at given xi,yi positions. If flag!=0, the xi,yi express fractions of the size
 of the current output device.
Doc: physically draw the rectwindow $w$. More generally,
 $w$ can be of the form $[w_{1},x_{1},y_{1},w_{2},x_{2},y_{2},\dots]$
 (number of components must be divisible by $3$; the windows $w_{1}$, $w_{2}$,
 etc.~are physically placed with their upper left corner at physical position
 $(x_{1},y_{1})$, $(x_{2},y_{2})$,\dots\ respectively, and are then drawn
 together.
 Overlapping regions will thus be drawn twice, and the windows are considered
 transparent. Then display the whole drawing in a window on your screen.
 If $\fl \neq 0$, $x_{1}$, $y_{1}$ etc. express fractions of the size of the
 current output device
