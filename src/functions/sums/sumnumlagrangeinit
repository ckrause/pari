Help: sumnumlagrangeinit({al}, {c1}): initialize tables for Lagrange
 summation of a series.
Doc: initialize tables for Lagrange summation of a series. $al$ can be
 either $2$, $1$ (default), $1/2$, $1/3$, or $1/4$; this initialization
 must be used if the asymptotic expansion of the remainder of the sum
 (minus one half of the last summand if $al=2$) is in integral powers
 of $1/N^{al}$. The constant $c1$ is technical and computed by the program,
 but can be set by the user: the number of interpolation steps will be
 chosen close to $c1\cdot B$, where $B$ is the bit accuracy.
