Help: hgmcoefs(H,t,n): (H,t) being a hypergeometric motive, returns the
 first n coefficients of its L-function, where Euler factors at bad primes
 are set to 1.
Doc: $(H,t)$ being a hypergeometric motive, returns the
 first $n$ coefficients of its $L$-function, where Euler factors at bad primes
 are set to 1. The argument $t$ may be replaced by $[t,\var{bad}]$
 where \var{bad} is a vector of pairs $[p,L_p]$, $p$ being a prime and $L_p$
 being the corresponding local Euler factor, overriding the default.

 If you hope that the bad Euler factors can be computed not too slowly
 from the functional equation, you can also do \kbd{L=lfunhgm(H,t)}, and then
 \kbd{lfunan(L,n)}, and then the Euler factors at bad primes will
 probably be correct.
