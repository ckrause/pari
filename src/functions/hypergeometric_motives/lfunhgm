Help: lfunhgm(H,t,{lim}): (H,t) being a hypergeometric motive, returns the
 corresponding lfuncreate data for use with the L function package.
Doc: $(H,t)$ being a hypergeometric motive, returns the corresponding
 \kbd{lfuncreate} data for use with the $L$-function package. This function
 needs to guess local conductors and euler factors at wild primes and
 will be very costly if there are many such primes: the complexity is roughly
 proportional to the conductor. The optional parameter \kbd{lim}
 allows the function to assume that Euler factors at wild primes have degree
 less than \kbd{lim}, which may speed it up a little. If your guess is wrong,
 the function will enter an infinite loop.

 ? H = hgminit([5]);
 ? L = lfunhgm(H, 1/64);
 time = 23,113 ms.
 ? L=lfunhgm(H,1/64,0); \\ assume Euler factors at wild primes are trivial
 time = 19,721 ms. \\ a little faster
