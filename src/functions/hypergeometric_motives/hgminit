Help: hgminit(a, {b}): Create the template for the hypergeometric
 motive with parameters a and possibly b. The format of the parameters may
 be alpha: Galois invariant lists of rational numbers a=alpha and b=beta;
 or cyclo: lists A and B of positive integers corresponding to alpha and beta;
 or gamma: list of cn such that the hypergeometric quotient is prod_n(x^n-1)^cn.
 The hypergeometric motive itself must be given by the template together
 with a nonzero rational number t.

Doc: Create the template for the hypergeometric motive with parameters
 $a$ and possibly $b$. The format of the parameters may be

 \item alpha: lists of rational numbers $a=(\alpha_j)$ and
 $b=(\beta_k)$ of the same length (and defined over $\Q$); if $b$ is
 omitted, we take it to be $(0,\dots,0)$.

 \item cyclo: lists $a=D$ and $b=E$ of positive integers corresponding
 to the denominators of the $(\alpha_i)$ and $(\beta_i)$; if $b$ is omitted
 we take it to be $(1,\dots,1)$.

 \item gamma: list of $\gamma_n$ such that the
 $\prod_j(x-\exp(2\pi i\alpha_j)) / \prod_k(x-\exp(2\pi i\beta_k))
 = \prod_n(x^n-1)^{\gamma_n}$.

 The hypergeometric motive itself must be given by the template together
 with a rational number $t\ne0$. Note that $t=1$ is accepted but treated
 specially.
