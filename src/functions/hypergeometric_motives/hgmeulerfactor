Function: hgmeulerfactor
Section: hypergeometric_motives
C-Name: hgmeulerfactor
Prototype: GGLD&
Help: hgmeulerfactor(H, t, p, {&e}): (H,t) being a hypergeometric motive,
 returns its Euler factor at the prime p and the exponent e of the conductor
 at p.
Doc: $(H,t)$ being a hypergeometric motive, returns its Euler factor at
 the prime $p$ and the exponent $e$ of the conductor at $p$. This is not
 implemented when $p$ is a bad prime: the function returns $0$ and sets
 $e$ to $-1$.

 If you hope that the bad Euler factors can be computed not too slowly
 from the functional equation, you can do \kbd{L=lfunhgm(H,t)}, and then
 the \kbd{lfunan} function should give you the correct coefficients
 including at bad primes, from which the Euler factor at $p$ can easily be
 recovered.
