Help: zetamult(s): multiple zeta value at integral s = [s1,...,sk].
Doc: For $s$ a vector of positive integers such that $s[1] \geq 2$,
 returns the multiple zeta value (MZV)
 $$\zeta(s_1,\dots, s_k) = \sum_{n_1>\dots>n_k>0} n_1^{-s_1}\dots n_k^{-s_k}.$$

 @eprog\noindent
 If the bit precision is $B$, this function runs in time $\tilde{O}(k B^2)$.

 In addition to the above format (\kbd{avec}), the function
 also accepts an internal binary format \kbd{evec} (each $s_i$ as replaced
 by $s_i$ bits, all of them 0 but the last one), and an \kbd{index} format
 (if $e$ is the positive integer attached the \kbd{evec} vector of
 bits, the index is the integer $e + 2^{k-2}$). The function
 \kbd{zetamultconvert} allows to pass from one format to the other; the
 function \kbd{zetamultall} computes simultaneously all MZVs of weight
 $\sum_{i\leq k} s_i$ up to $n$.
