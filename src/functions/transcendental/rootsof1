Help: rootsof1(N): vector of complex N-th roots of 1.
Doc: return the vector $v$ of all complex $N$-th roots of $1$, where $N$
 is a positive integer. In other words,
 $v[k] = \exp(2I(k-1)\pi/N)$ for $k = 1, \dots, N$. The roots $\pm1$ and
 $\pm I$ are given exactly, not as floating point numbers:
 \bprog
 ? rootsof1(4)
 %1 = [1, I, -1, -I]
 ? rootsof1(3)
 3 = [1, -1/2 + 0.866025...*I, -1/2 - 0.866025...*I]
