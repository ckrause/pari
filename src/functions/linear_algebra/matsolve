Help: matsolve(M,B): solution of MX=B (M matrix, B column vector).
Doc: $M$ being an invertible matrix and $B$ a column
 vector, finds the solution $X$ of $MX=B$, using Dixon $p$-adic lifting method
 if $M$ and $B$ are integral and Gaussian elimination otherwise. This
 has the same effect as, but is faster, than $M^{-1}*B$.

Variant: For integral input, the function
 \fun{GEN}{ZM_gauss}{GEN M,GEN B} is also available.
