Prototype: GD0,L,
Help: qfgaussred(q,{flag=0}): square reduction of the symmetric matrix q.
 flag=0: returns a square matrix A such that q(x) = sum_i A[i,i] (x[i] +
 sum_{j != i} A[i,j] x[j])^2; flag=1 return [U,V] where U is a square matrix
 and V a vector such that q = U~ * matdiagonal(V) * U

 \idx{decomposition into squares} of the
 quadratic form represented by the symmetric matrix $q$. If $\fl=0$ (default),
 the result is a matrix $M$ whose diagonal entries are the coefficients of the
 squares, and the off-diagonal entries on each line represent the bilinear
 forms. More precisely, if $(a_{ij})$ denotes the output, one has
 $$ q(x) = \sum_{i} a_{i,i} (x_{i} + \sum_{j \neq i} a_{i,j} x_{j})^2 $$
 \bprog
 ? qfgaussred([0,1;1,0])
 %1 =
 [1/2 1]

 [-1 -1/2]
 @eprog\noindent This means that $2xy = (1/2)(x+y)^{2} - (1/2)(x-y)^{2}$.
 Singular matrices are supported, in which case some diagonal coefficients
 vanish:
 \bprog
 ? qfgaussred([1,1;1,1])
 %2 =
 [1 1]

 [1 0]
 @eprog\noindent This means that $x^{2} + 2xy + y^{2} = (x+y)^{2}$.

 If $\fl=1$, return \kbd{[U,V]} where $U$ is a square matrix and $V$ a vector,
 such that if \kbd{D=matdiagonal(V)}, $q = {^{t}} U D U$. More
 precisely
 $$ q(x) = \sum_{i} D_{i} (\sum_{j} U_{i,j} x_{j})^{2} $$
 and the matrix $M$ is recovered as $M = U + D - 1$.
 \bprog
 ? q = [0,1;1,0];
 ? [U,V] = qfgaussred(q,1); D = matdiagonal(V);
 ? U~*D*U
 %5 =
 [0 1]

 [1 0]
 ? U+D-1
 %6 =
 [1/2    1]

Variant: See also the functions \fun{GEN}{qfgaussred}{GEN a}
 (for \kbd{qfgaussred(a,0)}),
 \fun{GEN}{qfgaussred2}{GEN a} (for \kbd{qfgaussred0(a,1)}). Finally,
 the function
 \fun{GEN}{qfgaussred_positive}{GEN q} assumes that $q$ is
 positive definite and is a little faster; returns \kbd{NULL} if a vector
 with negative norm occurs (non positive matrix or too many rounding errors).
