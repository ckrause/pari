Help: matreduce(m): reduce the factorization matrix m to canonical form
 (sorted first row with unique elments)
 matrix.
Doc: let $m$ be a factorization matrix, i.e., a 2-column matrix whose
 columns contains arbitrary ``generators'' and integer ``exponents''
 respectively. Returns the canonical form of $m$: the
 first column is sorted with unique elements and the second one contains the
 merged ``exponents'' (exponents of identical entries in the first column  of
 $m$ are added, rows attached to $0$ exponents are deleted). The generators are
 sorted with the universal \kbd{cmp} routine; in particular, this function is
 the identity on true integer factorization matrices, but not on other
 factorizations (in product of polynomials or maximal ideals, say). It is
 idempotent.
