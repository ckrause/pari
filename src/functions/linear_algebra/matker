Function: matker
Section: linear_algebra
C-Name: matker0
Prototype: GD0,L,
Help: matker(x,{flag}): basis of the kernel of the matrix x; flag is
 obsolete, ignore it.
Description:
 (gen, ?0):vec           ker($1)
 (gen, 1):vec            ZM_ker($1)
 (gen, #small)           $"incorrect flag in matker"
 (gen, small):vec        matker0($1, $2)
Doc: gives a basis for the kernel of the matrix $x$ as columns of a matrix.
 The matrix can have entries of any type, provided they are compatible with
 the generic arithmetic operations ($+$, $\times$ and $/$).

 The $\fl$ is kept for backward compatibility only: the function ignores it.

 In the case of \typ{INTMOD} coefficients, this is only guaranteed to work for
 prime modulus. In the case of composite modulus, a basis might not exist;
 however an alternative is provided by \tet{matkermod}.

Variant: You should use directly \fun{GEN}{ker}{GEN x}.
