C-Name: lfundiv
Prototype: GGb
Help: lfundiv(L1,L2): creates the Ldata structure (without
  initialization) corresponding to the quotient of the Dirichlet series
  given by L1 and L2.
Doc: creates the \kbd{Ldata} structure (without initialization) corresponding
  to the quotient of the Dirichlet series $L_{1}$ and $L_{2}$ given by
 \kbd{L1} and \kbd{L2}. Assume that $v_{z}(L_{1}) \geq v_{z}(L_{2})$ at all
 complex numbers $z$: the construction may not create new poles, nor increase
 the order of existing ones.
