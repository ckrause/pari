Prototype: GLD0,L,
Help: hyperellratpoints(X,h,{flag=0}): X being a non-singular hyperelliptic
 curve given by an integral model, return the affine rational points on the curve
 of naive height less than h.
 If fl=1, stop as soon as a point is found.
 X can be given either by a squarefree polynomial P such that
 X:y^2=P(x) or by a vector [P,Q] such that X:y^2+Q(x)y=P(x) and Q^2+4P is
 squarefree.
Doc: $X$ being a non-singular hyperelliptic curve given by an integral model,
 return the affine rational points on the curve of naive height less than $h.$
 If $\fl=1$, stop as soon as a point is found.
 The naive height is defined as the maximum of the absolute value of the
 numerator and the denominator of the abscissa of a point.  $X$ can be given
 either by a squarefree polynomial $P$ such that
 $X:y^2=P(x)$ or by a vector $[P,Q]$ such that $X:y^2+Q(x)\*y=P(x)$ and
 $Q^2+4\*P$ is squarefree.
