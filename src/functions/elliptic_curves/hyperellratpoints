Prototype: GGD0,L,
Help: hyperellratpoints(X,h,{flag=0}): X being a non-singular hyperelliptic
 curve given by an integral model, return the affine rational points on the curve
 of naive height less than h.
 If fl=1, stop as soon as a point is found.
 X can be given either by a squarefree polynomial P such that
 X:y^2=P(x) or by a vector [P,Q] such that X:y^2+Q(x)y=P(x) and Q^2+4P is
 squarefree.
Doc: $X$ being a non-singular hyperelliptic curve given by an integral model,
 return the affine rational points on the curve of naive height less than $h$.
 If $\fl=1$, stop as soon as a point is found.

 The parameter $h$ can be

 \item an integer $h$: find the points with abscissas with numerators and
 denominators both less than $h$.

 \item a vector $[n,d]$ with $d\leq n$: find the points with abscissas with
 numerators less than $n$ and denominators less than $d$.

 \item a vector $[n,[d1,d2]]$ with $d1<d2\leq n$  find the points with
 abscissas with numerators less than $n$ and denominators between $d1$ and
 $d2$.

 $X$ can be given either by a squarefree polynomial $P$ such that $X:y^2=P(x)$
 or by a vector $[P,Q]$ such that $X:y^2+Q(x)\*y=P(x)$ and $Q^2+4\*P$ is
 squarefree.
