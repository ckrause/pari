Function:ellmaninconstant
Section: elliptic_curves
C-Name: ellmaninconstant
Prototype: G
Help: ellmaninconstant(E): let E be an elliptic curve over Q given by
 ellinit or a rational isogeny class given by ellisomat. Return the
 Manin constant of the curve, see ellweilcurve.
 The algorithm is slow but unconditional.
Doc: let $E$ be an elliptic curve over $Q$ given by
 \kbd{ellinit} or a rational isogeny class given by ellisomat. Return the
 Manin constant of the curve, see \kbd{ellweilcurve}.
 The algorithm is slow but unconditional.
 The function also accepts the output of \kbd{ellisomat}, i.e. the isogeny class.
