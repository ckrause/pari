Function: ellfromeqn
Section: elliptic_curves
C-Name: ellfromeqn0
Prototype: GDG
Help: ellfromeqn(f,{P}): given a genus 1 plane curve, defined by the affine
 equation f(x,y) = 0, return the coefficients [a1,a2,a3,a4,a6] of a
 Weierstrass equation for its Jacobian.
 This allows to recover a Weierstrass model for an elliptic curve given by a
 general plane cubic or by a binary quartic or biquadratic model.

 If a binary quartic or biquadratic model is given, and if a point P is given,
 also return the image of P by the map from the curve to its Jacobian.

 Given a genus $1$ plane curve, defined by the affine equation $f(x,y) = 0$,
 return the coefficients $[a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},a_{4},a_{6}]$ of a Weierstrass
 equation for its Jacobian. This allows to recover a Weierstrass model for an
 elliptic curve given by a general plane cubic or by a binary quartic or
 biquadratic model. The function implements the $f \mapsto f^{*}$ formulae of
 Artin, Tate and Villegas (Advances in Math. 198 (2005), pp. 366--382).

 If a binary quartic or biquadratic model is given, and if a point $P$ is
 given, also return the image of $P$ by the map from the curve to its Jacobian.

 In the example below, the function is used to convert between twisted Edwards
 coordinates and Weierstrass coordinates.
 \bprog
 ? e = ellfromeqn(a*x^2+y^2 - (1+d*x^2*y^2))
 %1 = [0, -a - d, 0, -4*d*a, 4*d*a^2 + 4*d^2*a]
 ? E = ellinit(ellfromeqn(y^2-x^2 - 1 +(121665/121666*x^2*y^2)),2^255-19);
 ? isprime(ellcard(E) / 8)
 %3 = 1

 The elliptic curve attached to the sum of two cubes is given by
 \bprog
 ? ellfromeqn(x^3+y^3 - a)
 %1 = [0, 0, -9*a, 0, -27*a^2]
 @eprog

 \misctitle{Congruent number problem}
 Let $n$ be an integer, if $a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}$ and $a\*b=2\*n$,
 then by substituting $b$ by $2\*n/a$ in the first equation,
 we get $((a^{2}+(2\*n/a)^{2})-c^{2})\*a^{2} = 0$.
 We set $x=a$, $y=a\*c$.
 \bprog
 ? Cn = (x^2 + (2*n/x)^2 - (y/x)^2)*x^2;
 ? [En, Mn] = ellfromeqn(Cn, [x,y]);
 ? En
 %3 = [0, 0, 0, -16*n^2, 0]
 ? Mn
 %4 = [-16*n^2/y^2*x^2,-16*n^2/y^3*x^5+64*n^4/y^3*x]
 @eprog
 We check that \kbd{Mn} maps to a point on \kbd{En} (modulo \kbd{Cn}):
 \bprog
 ? ellisoncurve(ellinit(En), Mn*Mod(1,Cn))
 %5 = 1
 @eprog
 For example $23$ is congruent since the curve has a point of infinite order,
 namely:
 \bprog
 ? C = subst(Cn,n,23); E = ellinit(subst(En,n,23)); M = subst(Mn,n,23);
 ? H = ellheegner(E)
 %7 = [-406847/6084,245194145/474552]
 @eprog
 Using $M$, we can recover the point on the original curve.
 \bprog
 ? T = elltors(E).gen
 %8 = [[-92,0],[0,0]]
 ? P = elladd(E,T[2],ellmul(E,H,2));
 ? U = numerator(M[1] - P[1]);
 ? S = [[x,y]| y<-nfroots(,polresultant(U*y^2,C)) \
             ; x<-nfroots(,subst(C,'y,y))];
 ? [S[1],S[3]]
 %12 = [[-41496/3485,-1810283234/12145225],[-80155/20748,-20818257191/430479504]]
 Variant: Also available is \fun{GEN}{ellfromeqn}{GEN f} when $P$ is omitted.
