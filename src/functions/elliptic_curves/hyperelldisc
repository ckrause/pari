 $X$ being a nonsingular hyperelliptic model of a curve,
 defined over a field of characteristic distinct from 2, returns its discriminant.
 $X$ can be given either by a squarefree polynomial $P$ such that
 $X$ has equation $y^{2} = P(x)$ or by a vector $[P,Q]$ such that
 $X$ has equation $y^{2} + Q(x)\*y = P(x)$ and $Q^{2}+4\*P$ is squarefree.
