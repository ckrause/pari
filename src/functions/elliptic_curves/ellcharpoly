Help: ellcharpoly(E, {p}): given an elliptic curve E defined over
 a finite field Fq, return the characteristic polynomial of the Frobenius
 acting on the curve, for other fields of definition K, p must define a finite
 residue field, (p prime for K = Qp or Q; p a maximal ideal for K a number
 field), return the characteristic polynomial of the Frobenius acting  of the
 (nonsingular) reduction of E.

 Let \kbd{E} be an \kbd{ell} structure as output by \kbd{ellinit}, attached
 to an elliptic curve $E/K$. If the field $K = \F_{q}$ is finite, return the
 characteristic polynomial of the Frobenius acting on the curve.

 For other fields of definition and $p$ defining a finite residue field
 $\F_{q}$, return the characteristic polynomial of the Frobenius acting on the
 reduction of $E$: the argument $p$ is best left omitted if $K = \Q_{\ell}$
 (else we must have $p = \ell$) and must be a prime number ($K = \Q$) or prime
 ideal ($K$ a general number field) with residue field $\F_{q}$ otherwise. The
 equation need not be minimal or even integral at $p$; of course, a minimal
 model will be more efficient.
