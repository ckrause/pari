Help: hyperellred(C,{&m}): C being a nonsingular integral
 hyperelliptic model of a curve, return an integral model of C with
 the same discriminant but small coefficients.
 C can be given either by a squarefree polynomial P such that
 C:y^2=P(x) or by a vector [P,Q] such that C:y^2+Q(x)*y=P(x) and Q^2+4P is
 squarefree.

 $C$ being a nonsingular integral hyperelliptic model of a curve,
 return an integral model of $C$ with the same discriminant
 but small coefficients. The reduction is based on Cremona-Stoll reduction.

 $m$ is set to the mapping from the original model to the new one,
 a three-component vector \kbd{[1,[a,b;c,d],H]} such that $a*d-b*c=1$ and
 if $(x,y)$ is a point on $W$, the corresponding point on $C$ is given by
 $$
   x_C = (a*x+b)/(c*x+d)
 $$
 $$
   y_C = (y+H(x))/(c*x+d)^{g+1}
 $$
 where $g$ is the genus.
 $C$ can be given either by a squarefree polynomial $P$ such that
 $C: y^2 = P(x)$ or by a vector $[P,Q]$ such that
 $C: y^2 + Q(x)\*y = P(x)$ and $Q^2+4\*P$ is squarefree.
Variant:
 Also available is
 \fun{GEN}{ZX_hyperellred}{GEN P, GEN *M} where $C: y^2 = P(x)$ and *M is set to \kbd{[a,b;c,d]}
