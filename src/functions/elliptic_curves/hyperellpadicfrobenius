Help: hyperellpadicfrobenius(Q,q,n): Q being a rational polynomial of degree
 d and X being the curve defined by y^2=Q(x), return the matrix of the
 Frobenius at the prime q >= d in the standard basis of H^1_dR(X) to absolute
 q-adic precision q^n; q may also be of the form [T,p] where T is an integral
 polynomial which is irreducible mod p.
Doc:
 Let $X$ be the curve defined by $y^2=Q(x)$, where $Q$ is a polynomial of
 degree $d$ over $\Q$ and $q\ge d$ is a prime such that $X$ has good reduction
 at $q$. Return the matrix of the Frobenius endomorphism $\varphi$ on the
 crystalline module $D_p(X) = \Q_p \otimes H^1_{dR}(X/\Q)$ with respect to the
 basis of the given model $(\omega, x\*\omega,\ldots,x^{g-1}\*\omega)$, where
 $\omega = dx/(2\*y)$ is the invariant differential, where $g$ is the genus of
 $X$ (either $d=2\*g+1$ or $d=2\*g+2$).  The characteristic polynomial of
 $\varphi$ is the numerator of the zeta-function of the reduction of the curve
 $X$ modulo $q$. The matrix is computed to absolute $q$-adic precision $q^n$.

 Alternatively, $q$ may be of the form $[T,p]$ where $p$ is a prime,
 $T$ is a polynomial with integral coefficients whose projection to
 $\F_p[t]$ is irreducible, $X$ is defined over $K = \Q[t]/(T)$ and has good
 reduction to the finite field $\F_q = \F_p[t]/(T)$. The matrix of
 $\varphi$ on $D_q(X) = \Q_q \otimes H^1_{dR}(X/K)$ is computed
 to absolute $p$-adic precision $p^n$.
