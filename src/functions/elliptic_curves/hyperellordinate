Help: hyperellordinate(H,x): y-coordinates corresponding to x-coordinate x on
 hyperelliptic curve H.
 H can be given either by a squarefree polynomial P such that
 H:y^2=P(x) or by a vector [P,Q] such that H:y^2+Q(x)*y=P(x) and Q^2+4P is
 squarefree.

 gives a 0, 1 or 2-component vector containing
 the $y$-coordinates of the points of the curve $H$ having $x$ as
 $x$-coordinate.
 $H$ can be given either by a squarefree polynomial $P$ such that
 $H$ has equation $y^{2} = P(x)$ or by a vector $[P,Q]$ such that
 $H$ has equation $y^{2} + Q(x)\*y = P(x)$ and $Q^{2}+4\*P$ is squarefree.
