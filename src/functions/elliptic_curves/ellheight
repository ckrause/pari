Help: ellheight(E,{P},{Q}): Faltings height of the curve E, resp. canonical
 height of the point P on elliptic curve E, resp. the value of the attached
 bilinear form at (P,Q).
Doc:
 Without arguments $P,Q$, returns the Faltings height of the curve $E$.

 If the argument $P$ is present, returns the global N\'eron-Tate height
 $h(P)$ of the point $P$ on the elliptic curve
 $E/\Q$, using the normalization in Cremona's \emph{Algorithms for modular
 elliptic curves}. $E$ must be an \kbd{ell} as output by \kbd{ellinit}; it
 needs not be given by a minimal model although the computation will be faster
 if it is.

 If the argument $Q$ is present, computes the value of the bilinear
 form $(h(P+Q)-h(P-Q)) / 4$.

 Remark: the normalization chosen for Faltings height is that of Deligne.
 For a rational curve, the normalization is such that the function returns
 \kbd{-1/2*log(ellminimalmodel(E).area)}.

Variant: Also available is \fun{GEN}{ellheight}{GEN E, GEN P, long prec}
 ($Q$ omitted).
