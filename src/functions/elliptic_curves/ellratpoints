C-Name: ellratpoints
Prototype: GGD0,L,
Help: ellratpoints(E,h,{flag=0}): E being an integral model of an
 elliptic curve, return the list of affine rational points on the curve
 of naive height less than h.
 if fl=1, stop as soon as a point is found.
Doc: $E$ being an integral model of elliptic curve , return the list of affine
 rational points on the curve of naive height less than $h$
 if $\fl=1$, stop as soon as a point is found.
 See \kbd{hyperellratpoints} for how $h$ can be specified.
