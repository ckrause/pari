Function: vecmax
Section: operators
C-Name: vecmax0
Prototype: GD&
Help: vecmax(x,{&v}): largest entry in the vector/matrix x. If v
 is present, set it to the index of a largest entry (indirect max).
Description:
  (gen):gen            vecmax($1)
  (gen, &gen):gen      vecmax0($1, &$2)
Doc: if $x$ is a vector or a matrix, returns the largest entry of $x$,
 otherwise returns a copy of $x$. Error if $x$ is empty. Here, largest
 refers to the ordinary real ordering (\kbd{<=}).

 If $v$ is given, set it to the index of a largest entry (indirect maximum),
 when $x$ is a vector. If $x$ is a matrix, set $v$ to coordinates $[i,j]$
 such that $x[i,j]$ is a largest entry. This is ignored if $x$ is not a vector
 or matrix. When the vector has equal largest entries, the first occurence is
 chosen; in a matrix, the smallest $j$ is chosen first, then the smallest $i$.
 vector or matrix.

 \bprog
 ? vecmax([10, 20, -30, 40])
 %1 = 40
 ? vecmax([10, 20, -30, 40], &v); v
 %2 = 4
 ? vecmax([10, 20; -30, 40], &v); v
 %3 = [2, 2]

Variant: When $v$ is not needed, the function \fun{GEN}{vecmax}{GEN x} is
 also available.
