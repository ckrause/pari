Help: znchargalois(G,{ORD}): Let G be znstar(N, 1), return a list of
 representatives for the Galois orbits of Dirichlet characters mod N. If
 ORD is present, select characters depending on their orders:
 if ORD is a t_INT, restrict to orders less than this bound;
 if ORD is a t_VEC or t_VECSMALL, restrict to orders in the list.
Doc: Let $G$ be associated to $(\Z/N\Z)^*$ (as per \kbd{G = znstar(N,1)}),
 return a list of representatives for the Galois orbits of Dirichlet
 characters mod N. If
 \kbd{ORD} is present, select characters depending on their orders:

 \item if \kbd{ORD} is a \typ{INT}, restrict to orders less than this
 bound;

 \item if \kbd{ORD} is a \typ{VEC} or \typ{VECSMALL}, restrict to orders in
 the list.

 The characters are given by their Conrey logarithm, see \kbd{znconreylog}.

 \bprog
 ? G = znstar(96, 1);
 ? #znchargalois(G) \\ 16 orbits of characters mod 96
 %2 = 16
 ? #znchargalois(G,4) \\ order less than 4
 %3 = 12
 ? znchargalois(G,[1,4]) \\ order 1 or 4; 5 orbits
 %4 = [[0, 0, 0]~, [1, 2, 0]~, [1, 6, 1]~, [0, 2, 0]~, [0, 6, 1]~]
 @eprog\noindent
 Given a character $\chi$, of order $n$ (\kbd{charorder(G,chi)}), the
 elements in its orbit are the $\phi(n)$ characters $\chi^i$, $(i,n)=1$.
