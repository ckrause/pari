Help: factormodcyclo(n, p, {single=0}, {v='x}): factor n-th
 cyclotomic polynomial mod p.
Doc: Factors $n$-th cyclotomic polynomial $\Phi_{n}(x)$ mod $p$,
 where $p$ is a prime number not dividing $n$.
 Much faster than \kbd{factormod(polcyclo(n), p)}; the irreducible
 factors should be identical and given in the same order.
 If \var{single} is set, return a single irreducible factor; else (default)
 return all the irreducible factors. Note that repeated calls of this
 function with the \var{single} flag set may return different results because
 the algorithm is probabilistic. Algorithms used are as follows.

 Let $F=\Q(\zeta_{n})$. Let $K$ be the splitting field of $p$ in $F$ and $e$ the
 conductor of $K$. Then $\Phi_{n}(x)$ and $\Phi_{e}(x)$ have the same
 number of irreducible factors mod $p$ and there is a simple algorithm
 constructing irreducible factors of $\Phi_{n}(x)$ from irreducible
 factors of $\Phi_{e}(x)$. So we may assume $n$ is equal to the
 conductor of $K$.
 Let $d$ be the order of $p$ in $(\Z/n\Z)^{\times}$ and $\varphi(n)=df$.
 Then $\Phi_{n}(x)$ has $f$ irreducible factors $g_{i}(x)\;(1\leq i\leq f)$
 of degree $d$ over $\F_{p}$ or $\Z_{p}$.

 \item If $d$ is small, then we factor $g_{i}(x)$ into
 $d$ linear factors $g_{ij}(x)$, $1\leq j\leq d$ in $\F_{q}[x]\;(q=p^{d})$ and
 construct $G_{i}(x)=\prod_{j=1}^{d} g_{ij}(x)\in \F_{q}[x]$.
 Then $G_{i}(x)\in\F_{p}[x]$ and $g_{i}(x)=G_{i}(x)$.

 \item If $f$ is small, then we work in $K$, which is a Galois extension of
 degree $f$ over $\Q$. The Gaussian period
 $\theta_{k}=\text{Tr}_{F/K}(\zeta_{n}^{k})$ is a sum of $k$-th power of roots
 of $g_{i}(x)$ and $K=\Q(\theta_{1})$.

 Now, for each $k$, there is a polynomial $T_{k}(x)\in\Q[x]$ satisfying
 $\theta_{k}=T_{k}(\theta_{1})$ because all $\theta_{k}$ are in $K$. Let
 $T(x)\in\Z[x]$ be the minimal polynomial of $\theta_{1}$ over $\Q$. We get
 $\theta_{1}$ mod $p$ from $T(x)$ and construct $\theta_{1},\cdots,\theta_{d}$
 mod $p$ using $T_{k}(x)$. Finally we recover $g_{i}(x)$ from
 $\theta_{1},\cdots,\theta_{d}$ by Newton's formula.
