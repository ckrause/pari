Help: ramanujantau(n,{ell=12}): compute the value of Ramanujan's tau function
 at n, assuming the GRH. If ell is 16, 18, 20, 22, or 26, same for the
 newform of level 1 and corresponding weight. Otherwise, compute the
 coefficient of the trace form at n. Algorithm in O(n^{1/2+eps}).
Doc: compute the value of Ramanujan's tau function at an individual $n$,
 assuming the truth of the GRH (to compute quickly class numbers of imaginary
 quadratic fields using \tet{quadclassunit}). If \kbd{ell} is 16, 18, 20, 22,
 or 26, same for the newform of level 1 and corresponding weight. Otherwise,
 compute the coefficient of the trace form at n.
 Algorithm in $\tilde{O}(n^{1/2})$ using $O(\log n)$ space. If all values up
 to $N$ are required, then
 $$\sum \tau(n)q^n = q \prod_{n\geq 1} (1-q^n)^{24}$$
 and more generally
 $$\sum\tau_{\ell}(n)q^n = q \prod_{n\geq 1} (1-q^n)^{24}\Bigl(1-\dfrac{2(\ell-12)}{B_{\ell-12}}\sum_{n\ge1}\dfrac{n^{\ell-13}q^n}{1-q^n}\Bigr)$$
 will produce them in time $\tilde{O}(N)$, against $\tilde{O}(N^{3/2})$ for
 individual calls to \kbd{ramanujantau}; of course the space complexity then
 becomes $\tilde{O}(N)$. For other values of \kbd{ell},
 \kbd{mfcoefs(mftraceform([1,ell]),N)} is much faster.
