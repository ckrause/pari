Function: serPade
Section: number_theoretical
C-Name: serPade
Prototype: GLL
Help: serPade(x,p,q): returns a rational function approximation to x.
 This function applies to series, polynomials, and rational functions.
Doc: returns a rational function approximation $a/b$
 to $x$, with $a$ of degree $p$ and $b$ of degree $q$, with
 $x-a/b=O(t^(p+q+1+v))$ if $t$ is the variable, where $v$ is the valuation
 of $x$. This function is a convenience wrapper around \tet{bestapprPade}
