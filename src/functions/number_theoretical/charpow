Help: charpow(cyc, a,n): given a finite abelian group (by its elementary
 divisors cyc) a character a and an integer n return the character a^n.
Doc: let \var{cyc} represent a finite abelian group by its elementary
 divisors, i.e. $(d_{j})$ represents $\sum_{j \leq k} \Z/d_{j}\Z$ with $d_{k}
 \mid \dots \mid d_{1}$; any object which has a \kbd{.cyc} method is also
 allowed, e.g.~the output of \kbd{znstar} or \kbd{bnrinit}. A character
 on this group is given by a row vector $\chi = [a_{1},\ldots,a_{n}]$ such that
 $\chi(\prod g_{j}^{n_{j}}) = \exp(2\pi i\sum_{j} a_{j} n_{j} / d_{j})$,
 where $g_{j}$ denotes
 the generator (of order $d_{j}$) of the $j$-th cyclic component.

 Given $n\in \Z$ and a character $a$, return the character $a^{n}$.
 \bprog
 ? cyc = [15,5]; a = [1,1];
 ? charpow(cyc, a, 3)
 %2 = [3, 3]
 ? charpow(cyc, a, 5)
 %2 = [5, 0]
 ? bnf = bnfinit(x^2+23);
 ? bnf.cyc
 %4 = [3]
 ? charpow(bnf, [1], 3)
 %5 = [0]
 @eprog\noindent For Dirichlet characters on  $(\Z/N\Z)^{*}$, additional
 representations are available (Conrey labels, Conrey logarithm), see
 \secref{se:dirichletchar} or \kbd{??character} and the output uses the
 same format as the input.
 \bprog
 ? G = znstar(100, 1);
 ? G.cyc
 %2 = [20, 2]
 ? a = [10, 1]; \\ standard representation for characters
 ? b = 7; \\ Conrey label;
 ? c = znconreylog(G, 11); \\ Conrey log
 ? charpow(G, a,3)
 %6 = [10, 1]   \\ standard representation
 ? charpow(G, b,3)
 %7 = 43   \\ Conrey label
 ? charpow(G, c,3)
 %8 = [1, 8]~  \\ Conrey log

Variant: Also available is
 \fun{GEN}{charpow}{GEN cyc, GEN a, GEN n}, when \kbd{cyc} is known to
 be a vector of elementary divisors (no check).
