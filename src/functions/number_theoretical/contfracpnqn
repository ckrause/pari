Function: contfracpnqn
Section: number_theoretical
C-Name: contfracpnqn
Prototype: GD-1,L,
Help: contfracpnqn(x, {n=-1}): [p_n,p_{n-1}; q_n,q_{n-1}] corresponding to the
 continued fraction x. If n >= 0 is present, returns all convergents from
 p_0/q_0 up to p_n/q_n.
Doc: when $x$ is a vector or a one-row matrix, $x$
 is considered as the list of partial quotients $[a_{0},a_{1},\dots,a_{n}]$ of a
 rational number, and the result is the 2 by 2 matrix
 $[p_{n},p_{n-1};q_{n},q_{n-1}]$ in the standard notation of continued fractions,
 so $p_{n}/q_{n}=a_{0}+1/(a_{1}+\dots+1/a_{n})$. If $x$ is a matrix with two rows
 $[b_{0},b_{1},\dots,b_{n}]$ and $[a_{0},a_{1},\dots,a_{n}]$, this is then considered as a
 generalized continued fraction and we have similarly
 $p_{n}/q_{n}=(1/b_{0})(a_{0}+b_{1}/(a_{1}+\dots+b_{n}/a_{n}))$. Note that in this case one
 usually has $b_{0}=1$.

 If $n \geq 0$ is present, returns all convergents from $p_{0}/q_{0}$ up to
 $p_{n}/q_{n}$. (All convergents if $x$ is too small to compute the $n+1$
 requested convergents.)
