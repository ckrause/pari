Help: halfgcd(x,y): return a vector [M, [a,b]~], where M is an invertible 2x2
 matrix such that M*[a,b]~ = [x,y]~, where b < sqrt(max(|x|,|y|)) <= a.
Doc: return a vector \kbd{[M, [a,b]~]}, where $M$ is an invertible $2\times 2$
 matrix such that \kbd{M*[x,y]~ = [a,b]~}.

 The objects $x$ and $y$ can be both integers, or both polynomials in the same
 variable.

 In the polynomial case, the inegality
 $\deg a \geq \ceil{\max(\deg x,\deg y))/2} > \deg b$
 holds and the determinant of $M$ is of degree $0$.

 In the integer case, the inequality
 $a \geq \ceil{\sqrt{\max(|x|,|y|)}} > b$
 holds and $\det M = \pm 1$.
 Assuming $x$ and $y$ are non-negative, then
 $M^{-1}$ has non-negative coefficients, and $\det M$
 is equal to the sign of both main diagonal terms.
