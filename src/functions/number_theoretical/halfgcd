Help: halfgcd(x,y): return a vector [M, [a,b]~], where M is an invertible 2x2
 matrix such that M*[a,b]~ = [x,y]~, where b < sqrt(max(|x|,|y|)) <= a.
Doc:
 Let inputs $x$ and $y$ be both integers, or both polynomials in the same
 variable. Return a vector \kbd{[M, [a,b]\til]}, where $M$ is an invertible
 $2\times 2$ matrix such that \kbd{M*[x,y]\til = [a,b]\til}.

 In the polynomial case, the determinant of $M$ has degree $0$ and we have
 $$\deg a \geq \ceil{\max(\deg x,\deg y))/2} > \deg b.$$

 In the integer case,  $\det M = \pm 1$ and we have
 $$a \geq \ceil{\sqrt{\max(|x|,|y|)}} > b.$$
 Assuming $x$ and $y$ are non-negative, then $M^{-1}$ has non-negative
 coefficients, and $\det M$ is equal to the sign of both main diagonal terms
 $M[1,1]$ and $M[2,2]$.
