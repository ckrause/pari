Help: divisorslenstra(N, r, s): finds all divisors d of N such that d = r
 (mod s). Assume that (r,s) = 1 and s^3 > N.
Doc: Given three integers $N > s > r \geq 0$ such that $(r,s) = 1$
 and $s^3 > N$, find all divisors $d$ of $N$ such that $d \equiv r \pmod{s}$.
 There are at most $11$ such divisors (Lenstra).
