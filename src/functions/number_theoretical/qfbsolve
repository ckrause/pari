Help: qfbsolve(Q,n): return the list of solutions [x,y] of the equation
 Q(x,y)=n in coprime integers x and y where Q is a binary quadratic form,
 up to the action of the special orthogonal group of Q over the integers.
Doc: Return the list of solutions $[x,y]$ of the equation $Q(x,y)=n$ in
 coprime integers $x$ and $y$, where $Q$ is a binary quadratic form and
 $n$ an integer, up to the action of the special orthogonal group
 $S=SO(Q,\Z)$, which is isomorphic to the group of units of positive norm
 of the quadratic order of discriminant $D = \disc Q$.

 The result is a vector of two-components vectors $[x,y]$.

 If $D>0$, $S$ is infinite. If $D<-4$, $S$ is of order $2$, if $D=-3$, $S$ is
 of order $6$ and if $D=-4$, $S$ is of order $4$.

 Assuming the factorisation of $n$ is given, for each prime factor $p$ of $n$,
 the algorithm used runs in probabilistic polynomial time
 in $p$ (through the computation of square roots of $D$ modulo $4\*p$); it is
 polynomial time in $D$ if $Q$ is imaginary, but exponential time if $Q$ is
 real (through the computation of a full cycle of reduced forms). In the
 latter case, note that \tet{bnfisprincipal} provides a solution in heuristic
 subexponential time in $D$ assuming the GRH.
