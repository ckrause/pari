Function: factormod
Section: number_theoretical
C-Name: factormod0
Prototype: GGD0,L,
Help: factormod(f,p,{flag=0}): factors the polynomial f modulo the prime p;
 flag is optional, and can be 0: default or 1: only the degrees of the
 irreducible factors are given.
Doc: factors the polynomial $f$ modulo the prime integer $p$.
 The coefficients of $f$ must be operation-compatible with
 $\Z/p\Z$. The result is a two-column matrix, the first column being the
 irreducible polynomials dividing $f$, and the second the exponents.
 By convention, the $0$ polynomial factors as $0^1$; a non-zero constant
 polynomial has empty factorization, a $0\times 2$ matrix. The irreducible
 factors are ordered by increasing degree and the result is canonical: it will
 not change across multiple calls or sessions.

 If $\fl$ is non-zero, outputs only the \emph{degrees} of the irreducible
 polynomials (for example to compute an $L$-function). By convention, a
 constant polynomial (including the $0$ polynomial) has empty factorization.
 The degrees appear in increasing order but need not correspond to the
 ordering with $\fl =0$ when multiplicities are present.
